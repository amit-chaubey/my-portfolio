# Creating an AI-Powered UK Visa Navigator

Having gone through the UK visa process myself, I built an AI assistant to help others navigate this complex system more easily.

## The Problem

The UK visa application process can be:
- Overwhelming with numerous visa types
- Complex with changing requirements
- Time-consuming to research
- Difficult to track requirements

## The Solution

I developed a Python-based assistant that:
- Helps identify the right visa type
- Provides requirement checklists
- Offers guidance on documentation
- Tracks application progress
