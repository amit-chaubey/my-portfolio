# Integrating Neo4j with AI: Building Knowledge Graphs

In this post, I'll share my experience building AI-powered knowledge graphs using Neo4j, and how they can enhance learning systems.

## Why Knowledge Graphs?

Knowledge graphs provide:
- Rich context for AI models
- Better relationship understanding
- Enhanced query capabilities
- Improved recommendation systems

## Implementation Details

Here's a simple example of how we connect Neo4j with our AI system:

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Connect to Neo4j

```

## Benefits of Knowledge Graphs

- Enhanced context for AI models
- Better relationship understanding
- Enhanced query capabilities

## Practical Applications

### 1. Enhanced Learning Systems

### 2. Recommendation Engines

### 3. Content Management
